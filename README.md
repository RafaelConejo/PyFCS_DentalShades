# PyFCS Dental Shades

## Description

This repository contains the execution framework for the **Expert Validation Interface** and **PyFCS Dental GUI** software, including everything needed to install and use it.

All the code in this project builds upon the core components of the [**PyFCS**](https://github.com/RafaelConejo/PyFCS) ecosystem, developed by the same author. The PyFCS repository also includes documentation on the fuzzy reasoning engine and the graphical user interface.

The validation software allows clinical and expert users to evaluate dental shade classifications based on fuzzy conceptual models. It integrates seamlessly with the fuzzy color space constructed via the PyFCS GUI and supports reproducible evaluation workflows aligned with perceptual reasoning.

For an overview of how the repositories are organized and how each component contributes to the system, see the section [Repository Structure and Component Distribution](#repository-structure-and-component-distribution).

## Repository Structure and Component Distribution

The complete system for expert validation and visualization of the fuzzy color space in dentistry is distributed across two main repositories:

### ðŸ”¹ [`Expert_Validation_Interface`](https://github.com/RafaelConejo/Expert_Validation_Interface)

This repository contains all components required to run the **expert validation module**, which is fully integrated into the **PyFCS** ecosystem. Key features include:

- Implemented in **Python** using the **Tkinter** framework.
- Supports reproducible evaluation workflows.
- Seamless integration with the fuzzy reasoning core.
- Full documentation and usage instructions available in the main repository: [`PyFCS_DentalShades`](https://github.com/RafaelConejo/PyFCS_DentalShades).

### ðŸ”¹ [`PyFCS_Dental_GUI`](https://github.com/RafaelConejo/PyFCS_Dental_GUI)

This repository hosts the graphical interface for **interactive creation and visualization** of the fuzzy color space. Key functionalities include:

1. **Construction of the fuzzy color model**: allows users to input CIE-L\*a\*b\* coordinates for each shade prototype, define positive and negative reference categories, and generate the corresponding fuzzy color volumes. This process includes:
   - Voronoi-based tessellation.
   - Scaling to define *core*, *Î±-cut* (e.g., 0.5 level), and *support* regions.
   - An additional prototype representing the black background commonly used in dental photography to reduce misclassification.

   The resulting fuzzy color space includes 17 fuzzy colors (16 shades from the VITA Classical Shade Guide plus the black background), formally defined as:

   \[
   \tilde{C}_{VITA} = \{\tilde{C}_{A1}, \tilde{C}_{A2}, \ldots, \tilde{C}_{D4}, \tilde{C}_{\text{BLACK}}\}
   \]

2. **Interactive 3D visualization**: offers an intuitive environment to explore and analyze the constructed fuzzy color space, featuring:
   - Menus for loading images, selecting shades, and managing model components.
   - Panels displaying the geometric volumes of each fuzzy region (*core*, *Î±-cut*, *support*).
   - Interactive controls for zooming, panning, and rotating to inspect spatial relationships and distribution patterns.

These enhanced visualization tools support both verification and interpretation of the fuzzy color model, bridging technical modeling and perceptual reasoning in clinical dental shade matching.

## PyFCS_Dental_GUI
### ðŸ”§ Installation
If no modifications to the source code are needed, follow these steps for a quick installation on **Windows**:

1. Access the project repository on GitHub and download the library using the **"Clone or Download"** button, or from the **Releases** section by downloading the `.zip` file.
2. Extract the contents of the `.zip` file to a preferred local folder.
3. Make sure you have **Python 3.9 or higher** installed, along with **pip** (or use an environment manager like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)).
   - To install pip manually (if not already available), you can run:
     ```bash
     python -m ensurepip --upgrade
     ```
4. Open a terminal (CMD or PowerShell), navigate to the root directory of the project, and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r PyFCS\external\requirements.txt
   ```
5. Once the dependencies are installed, launch the main interface structure by executing:
    ```bash
    python PyFCS\visualization\basic_structure.py
    ```
